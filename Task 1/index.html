        <h3>What is Agoraphobia?</h3>
        <p>Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder that covers diverse categories of fears associated with a desire to escape from a situation that makes the individual uncomfortable. Agoraphobia causes people to avoid places and situations where they might feel trapped, helpless, panicked, embarrassed or out of their comfort zone.
            <br>An individual struggling with agoraphobia often fears embarrassing themselves in public or experiencing a panic attack in a social setting. The fear can develop so intensely that the individual will avoid leaving their home, even when in need of medical care. They often have a fear of leaving their house and a fear of going outside.
            <br>Many individuals dealing with agoraphobia fear to be alone, leaving home, experiencing public humiliation, being in crowded situations or being in a confined place, such as an elevator, car, plane, subway or boat.
            <br>Agoraphobia not only affects the person who experiences the disorder, but it also affects their loved ones, job and social life.

    <h1>types of agoraphobia</h1>
    <p><b>Paranoid Agoraphobia</b>
        <br>Paranoid agoraphobia is a combination of two conditions: paranoia and agoraphobia. Paranoia is the presence of false beliefs or heavily concentrating on something that is true, which often causes someone to feel endangered or threatened.  Agoraphobia, on the other hand, is an extreme fear of feeling out of your comfort zone and not being able to escape.
        <br>Paranoia and agoraphobia may seem similar, as both conditions involve extreme fear and a reluctance to leave home. However, paranoia is based on fixed, false beliefs. Conversely, agoraphobia is associated with a fear of having a panic attack or failing to receive help while in an uncomfortable situation.
        <br><b>Claustrophobia</b>
        <br>Individuals suffering from claustrophobia fear small, confined spaces. Their extreme levels of anxiety cause them to avoid small spaces do to fight over being confined or trapped. Claustrophobia is a fairly common condition, which can dissipate or with effective treatment for claustrophobia.
        <br><b>Disorganized Agoraphobia</b>
        <br>Because people with agoraphobia often have difficulty maintaining their mental and physical balance, they rely more on visual and tactical senses. Their visual and tactile signals can become distorted if incorrectly translated by the brain. The individual may feel like they are going to fall as they feel the wind blow while walking over a bridge. Because their sense of balance is not accurate, the communication between their five senses and their brain becomes disorganized and the person struggles to feel stable. This miscommunication can create severe panic.
        <br><b>Catatonic Agoraphobia</b>
        <br>The catatonic state is a phrase used to describe the inability to move in an ordinary way. Catatonic agoraphobia causes an inability to speak or move when placed in a situation of fear. Picking up a jar, entering a room or rising from the sitting position can be difficult for these individuals. The person may panic and struggle to carry out tasks, which can be dangerous. For example, some people experience catatonic agoraphobia when attempting to drive across a bridge
        <br><b>Enochlophobia</b>
        <br>Enochlophobia is a common social phobia that involves an irrational fear of large crowds. Women tend to be affected by this condition more than men. Individuals with Enochlophobia tend to avoid events such as concerts and sporting events due to extreme worry.</p>
